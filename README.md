# Panera Bread Survey

This was a project I worked on with five others, and my part includes a visualization, insights into my visualization, and an ML analysis using Gradient Boosting. This was a very fun project to work on towards the end of the year, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning this and data science as a whole.
